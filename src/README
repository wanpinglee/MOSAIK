To compile MOSAIK, simply type "make". When the compilation is complete, you 
will find the MOSAIK binaries in the ../bin directory.

By default, Makefile behavior is tuned to Linux distributions. If you want to
compile MOSAIK in Mac OS X, simply set the BLD_PLATFORM environment variable
to macosx. e.g.

export BLD_PLATFORM=macosx

In addition to 'linux' and 'macosx', we have included another build platform:

'macosx64' - fyzkem was kind enough to enable 64-bit support for the Mac OS X
             version of MOSAIK.

If you want to add another set of settings to configure the Makefile, simply
add a new .inc file in the includes directory and set the BLD_PLATFORM variable
accordingly (without the .inc suffix).

All of the source code within is dual licensed under the GPL 2.0+ and via
a commerical license available from the Marth Lab. 

The exception to this is public domain code used within MOSAIK:

1. fastlz by Ariya Hidayat - http://www.fastlz.org/
2. MD5 implementation - RSA Data Security, RFC 1321

All of the common routines shared between the various MOSAIK tools can be found
in the CommonSource subdirectory. All of the MOSAIK tools have subdirectories
in the src directory. All compiled object code is stored in the ../obj directory.
