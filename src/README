To compile MOSAIK, simply type 'make' from inside the src/ directory. When the
compilation is complete, you will find the MOSAIK binaries in the bin/
directory.

By default, Makefile behavior is tuned to Linux distributions. If you want to
compile MOSAIK in Mac OS X, set the BLD_PLATFORM environment variable to either
'macosx' or 'macosx64' (64-bit support was kindly added by fyzkem). For example:

'export BLD_PLATFORM=macosx64'

The GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) is not bundled with some recent versions of
Mac OS X, and must be installed in order to compile MOSAIK without errors.
Once installed, the g++ binary should be specified during compilation like so:

'make CXX=/path/to/g++/binary'

If you want to add another set of settings to configure the Makefile, simply
add a new .inc file in the includes directory and set the BLD_PLATFORM variable
accordingly (without the .inc suffix).

MOSAIK is open source software, licensed under the GPL 2.0+, and is provided 
free-of-charge to all users. All we ask in return is that you acknowledge its 
use in publications, talks, etc.

The exception to this is public domain code used within MOSAIK:

1. fastlz by Ariya Hidayat - http://www.fastlz.org/
2. MD5 implementation - RSA Data Security, RFC 1321

All of the common routines shared between the various MOSAIK tools can be found
in the CommonSource subdirectory. All of the MOSAIK tools have subdirectories
in the src directory. All compiled object code is stored in the ../obj directory.
